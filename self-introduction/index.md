Hello. My name is Vladimir, I am a beginner front-end developer.
I was born in the city of Pinsk, Republic of Belarus.
I graduated from the Belarusian State Agrarian Technical University, and I have a diploma in electrical engineering and worked for two years as a labor safety engineer in an agricultural organization.
At the Department of Applied Computer Science, I became acquainted with the C++ programming language. I found it quite interesting, but confusing. Subsequently, I did not have much experience in the Python programming language, which is quite simple in the initial stages. On the recommendation of a friend, I decided to try to study the profession of front-end developer. I started with a simple internet search to find out what kind of profession this was. I was lucky that I came across the RS School website, which was recruiting students to become entry-level front-end developers. Which I signed up for. There I was introduced to the HTML markup language with CSS, the JavaScript programming language, and the GIT version control system.
At school I gained the knowledge and skills of creating websites supported by various popular browsers. Adapt the site for different devices. After completing the courses, I realized that I really liked creating websites and I continued my studies by signing up for the next course.
During my studies, I realized that I did not have a sufficient level of English, only A two. In parallel with my studies at RS School, I began to improve my level of English using the duolingo application.
In the future, I would like to develop in this direction, study new technologies and apply them in practice, and participate in large projects.
Thank you for watching this video to the end.
